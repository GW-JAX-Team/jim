# Summary

Parameter estimation is the primary tool for extracting astrophysical
information from gravitational wave signals.

## Key features

- **GPU and Machine learning accelerated sampling**

- **Flexible transform system**:

- **Cloud-ready deployment**

# Statement of need

In the last couple of years, multiple groups have been developing faster parameter estimation codes [@Wong:2023lgb] [@Roulet:2022kot] [@Dax:2021tsq] [@Ashton:2018jfp] to tackle the pressure of the rapidly increasing number of gravitational wave detections. 
While the development of these codes has been impressive regarding their performance, adoption outside of the core development team remains limited.


To make sure the broader community can benefit from these 

<!-- Need for speed -->

<!-- Need for flexibility -->

<!-- Need for production ready infrastructure -->
